## The Scrum Team
The Scrum Team consists of a **Product Owner**, the **Development Team** (3 to 7 people), and a **Scrum Master**.
Scrum Teams are **self-organizing** and **cross-functional**. Self-organizing teams choose how best to
accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional
teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
part of the team.  
The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize **flexibility**, **creativity**, and
**productivity**.  
The essence of Scrum is a small team of **people**. The individual team is highly flexible and
adaptive.  
Scrum Teams deliver products **iteratively** and **incrementally**, maximizing opportunities for
**feedback**. Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of
**working product is always available**.

## Definition of Scrum
Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while
productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.  
Scrum is:  
- Lightweight  
- Simple to understand  
- Difficult to master  

Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a
framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear
the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can
continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment.

The Scrum framework consists of **Scrum Teams** and their associated roles, **events**, **artifacts**, and
**rules**. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to
Scrum’s success and usage.


## Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
**knowledge comes from experience** and making decisions based on **what is known**. Scrum
employs an **iterative**, **incremental approach** to optimize predictability and control risk.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: **transparency**,
**inspection**, and **adaptation**.

## 5 Scrum Values
When the values of **commitment**, **courage**, **focus**, **openness** and **respect** are embodied and lived
by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of **transparency**, **inspection**, and **adaptation** come to life
and build **trust** for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they
work with the Scrum roles, events, and artifacts.

The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be
open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members
**respect** each other to be **capable**, **independent people**.
