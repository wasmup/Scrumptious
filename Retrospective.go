// Retrospective struct
// Sprint Retrospective
// The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
// for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.
// The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.
// This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is
// usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants
// understand its purpose.
// The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive. The Scrum Master
// teaches all to keep it within the time-box. The Scrum Master participates as a peer team
// member in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum process.
// The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
// • Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
// • Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
// • Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.
// The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process
// framework, its development process and practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for
// the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase
// product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of “Done”, if appropriate
// and not in conflict with product or organizational standards.
// By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements
// that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is
// the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be
// implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on
// inspection and adaptation.
